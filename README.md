# 3D-printed-RX-TX-Optic-fiber
I made this homemade optic fiber Transmitter / Receiver (RX/TX), using just discrete components as transistors, IR LED, IR PhotoTransistor and a 3d Printer.
This can be be used in a Solid State Tesla Coil to be controlled with an Interrupter circuit.
It's a simple but interesting project, made for didactic purpose

models in stl files are scaled up, to print them correctly set scale to 0.1 into Slicer
